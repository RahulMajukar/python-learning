# Python Classes/Objects
# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# Class is blue print for objects
# objects are the real world entity

class MyClass:
  x = 5
  
#   Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

# updating class values
p1.x=12
print(p1.x)
